# virtual-better-align

Align equal signs and colons on adjacent lines, but not by inserting spaces but by just visually shifting text around.

## Why?
Aligning assignments vertically makes it easier to recognize the structure of the code. But actually inserting space characters has disadvantates, because it can mean changes to unrelated lines in your `git diff` just to keep the alignment correct. And incorrect alignment is worse than no alignment.

The solution is to introduce the necessary spaces only virtually, in the editor, but not in the file on disk.
